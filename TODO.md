# TODO

Keeping track of the things to do:

- [-] Add type annotations
- [-] Check code to be PEP8-compliant
- [x] Build high-level API
- [x] Decide upon a dataset
- [x] Get dataset into a database
- [x] Prepare the experimental setup: create folds, write metric
- [x] Exploratory data analysis
- [x] Implement "addData" REST point
- [x] Implement and evaluate some baselines
- [x] Add a class for dataset
- [x] Create a subset of the data for quick testing
- [x] Implement and evaluate an item-based prediction method
- [x] Improve baseline recommender to monitor RMSE metric and stop the changes are small
- [x] Understand results: visualize similarity matrix, baselines, compare methods
- [ ] Write details on each algorithm
- [ ] Save evaluation report to disk
- [ ] Regenerate database with not-nullable constraint and float ratings
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Clean up `README.md`: split in `TODO.md` and `IDEAS.md`
- [ ] Implement a more advanced neighbouring method that uses baselines as well
- [?] Update recommender and dataset in the `addData` entrypoint
- [ ] Extra: Implement more entry points: find similar jokes to a given joke
- [ ] Extra: Implement and evaluate a matrix factorization method
- [ ] Extra: Predict ratings from items' features
